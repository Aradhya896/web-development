    <h1>seasons</h1>
    <p>Seasons are divisions of the year marked by changes in weather, temperature, and daylight. These changes result from the Earth’s orbit around the Sun and the tilt of its axis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Winter </li>
        <li>Spring </li>
        <li>Summer </li>
        <li>Autumn </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scientific Reason for Seasons</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Earth’s Tilted Axis</dt>
        <dd>The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees from the vertical. <br>
         This tilt does not change as Earth orbits the Sun.</dd>
         <dt>Earth’s Revolution Around the Sun</dt>
         <dd>The Earth takes 365.25 days to revolve around the Sun. <br>
          As it moves, different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of sunlight. <br>
          When a hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it gets more sunlight → warmer → Summer. <br>
          When a hemisphere tilts away from the Sun, it gets less sunlight → colder → Winter.</dd>
